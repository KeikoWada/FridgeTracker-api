## The story about development process and problem-solving strategy.
   my process was
   1) back-end side
   2) front-end side
   tried to check if all function is working in each steps before move on to the next steps.
   for example, in back-end side, if I make table, i checked curl request in terminal, then move on to making relation between the table and table.


## List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
  - haven't get to creat join table yet
